Open issue #$ARGUMENTS, analyze it and create a plan for implementing it.
ALWAYS ask me any clarifying questions that you think would be helpful to know before starting work.
Then, refine the plan as needed, add that plan as a comment to the issue
Create a new branch for the work, implement the changes, commit them to the branch, push the branch to origin, create a PR for the work.
Avoid needing to use the `node` CLI command.
